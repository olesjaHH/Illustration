                <h1>real beauty resides in imperfection</h1>
                <p>In a digital era, we sometimes feel the need to interact with something more human that will make us
                    appreciate both the beauty and the imperfection of something made by hand.

                <p>This series of illustrations paradoxically combines absurdity and a deep sense of childishness and
                    naivety.

            <p>Welcome to my space for experiments! Look at this like a journey we can take together every step of the
                way, beginning another chapter with each new phase of the project development. And who knows where it
                will take us?
